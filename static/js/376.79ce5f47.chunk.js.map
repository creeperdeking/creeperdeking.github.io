He\n        was launched into public notoriety while working for the RAND\n        corporation with his book\n        <em>On Thermonuclear War (1960)</em>\n        (which made him one of the inspirations for the eponymous character in\n        Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove). He became an influential voice in\n        policy and forecasting. He does not possess the kind of cult following\n        that could keep his ideas and legacy alive like Ayn Rand or the Club of\n        Rome, prehaps because his predictions were by and large quite reasonable\n        and accurate (boring?), . In addition, his books are not always written\n        in a very rigorous, scholarly manner. Add to that being the founder and\n        head of the Hudson Institute, a right leaning think tank, and that his\n        ideas reflected his generation's focus on progress and economic growth,\n        you can see why they might not be particularly fashionable to what he\n        defines as the \"New Class\" of upper middle class intelligentia that have\n        emerged since the 1960s.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        After reading four of his books <em>On Thermonuclear War (1960)</em> ,\n        <em>The Year 2000 (1967)</em>, <em>The Next 200 Years (1976)</em> and\n        <em>World Economic Development: 1979 And Beyond (1979)</em>, I became\n        convinced that he offers us a fascinating window into the post-war\n        mentality and attitude toward the future. Certainly his ideas are worth\n        revisiting with the benefit of hindsight, since much of his work is\n        concerned with forecasting. It is important to note that his forecasting\n        books reflect not only his work but those of his colleagues at the\n        Hudson Institute as well. After comparing his predictions with what\n        actually happenned, I think his books at the time would have provided\n        the businessman and political leader alike with a useful framework to\n        approach the great trends of the future as it was actually going to\n        unfold, despite some inevitable mistakes. As far as forcasting go,\n        that's as good as it gets. For this reason alone it's worth trying to\n        see how we fit in Hermann Kahn's future. Because in many ways we are\n        living in his \"World A\".\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        For my part, I now include him in this type of clear, practical thinkers\n        born around 1920, people that could combine quality, detailed knowledge\n        with useful broad abstractions. People such as Lee Kwan Yew, Richard\n        Feynman and Henry Kissinger.\n      </p>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <br />\n\n      <h2 id=\"the-great-transition\">The Great Transition</h2>\n      <figure\n        style={{\n          float: \"right\",\n          margin: \"0\",\n          padding: \"1em\",\n          paddingBottom: \"2em\",\n        }}\n      >\n        <img\n          src={greatTransitionImage}\n          alt=\"The Great Transition\"\n          style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", height: \"auto\", display: \"block\" }}\n        />\n      </figure>\n\n      <p>\n        For Hermann Kahn, modernity is a process characterized by an S-curve,\n        moving us from the pre-industrial to the post-industrial society, and he\n        viewed the 1970s as the approximate middlepoint of this transition.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In <em>The Year 2000</em>, he defines five stages for the great\n        transition. Why split it into stages? Indeed, Kahn speculates that in\n        the far future, the great transition will probably be viewed as one\n        continuous process, much like we view the agricultural revolution today.\n        Yet the stages provide insights into the changing nature of the economy.\n        He even gives us a rough range of the gdp per capita for each stage to\n        make the picture more concrete:\n      </p>\n\n      <table>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Stage</th>\n          <th>Economic makeup</th>\n          <th>GDP per capita</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Preindustrial</th>\n          <td>Agriculture is the economy</td>\n          <td>{\"~$300 -> ~$1300\"}</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Partially industrialized or transitional</th>\n          <td>Agriculture declines as a share of GDP, industry grows</td>\n          <td>{\"~$1300 -> ~$4000\"}</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Industrial</th>\n          <td>\n            Growth of both industry and services (including transportation),\n            agriculture is a small share of GDP\n          </td>\n          <td>{\"~$4000 -> ~$10000\"}</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Mass consumption or advanced industrial</th>\n          <td>\n            Industry starts declining as a share of GDP, while services continue\n            to grow\n          </td>\n          <td>{\"~$10000 -> ~$27000\"}</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Postindustrial</th>\n          <td>\n            Both industry and agriculture become an ever smaller share of GDP,\n            and even most classical services decline, as most industrial and\n            commercial tasks get gradually automated\n          </td>\n          <td>{\"~$27000 -> ~$130000\"}</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n\n      <figcaption>\n        Figures taken from \"The Year 2000\", converted to 2011 US dollars.\n      </figcaption>\n\n      <p>\n        He delineates the usual caveats about equating gdp per capita with\n        standard of living, for example pointing out that altough the Soviet\n        Union might get close to the mass consumption stage, lower level of\n        consumption caused by high level of investments in capital goods and the\n        military lowers the effective standard of living of soviet citizens. Yet\n        he believes that these range are still helpful to get a picture of the\n        general trend.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        How do we actually measure up with respect to his development stages?\n      </p>\n      <figure\n        style={{\n          float: \"right\",\n          margin: \"0\",\n          padding: \"1em\",\n          paddingBottom: \"2em\",\n        }}\n      >\n        <img\n          src={gdpCapImage}\n          alt=\"GDP per capta for a few countries\"\n          style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", height: \"auto\", display: \"block\" }}\n        />\n        <figcaption>\n          GDP per capita figures taken from ourworldindata.org, overlayed with\n          the stages of the great transition.

Indeed, the United States has gotten\n        there aruond the late 1970s, while he was still writing. Thus the post\n        industrial society is not some far off future, but it should to an\n        extent describe the societies we live in today. What did he believe\n        would be the characteristics of our post-industrial societies?\n      </p>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <br />\n\n      <h2 id=\"the-post-industrial-society\">The Post-Industrial society</h2>\n\n      <figure\n        style={{\n          margin: \"2em -50%\",\n          width: \"200%\",\n          maxWidth: \"200%\",\n          padding: \"1em\",\n          paddingBottom: \"2em\",\n          boxSizing: \"border-box\",\n        }}\n      >\n        <img\n          src={prologueAndThePromiseImage}\n          alt=\"The Prologue And the Promise\"\n          style={{ width: \"100%\", height: \"auto\", display: \"block\" }}\n        />\n        <figcaption>The Prologue And the Promise, Robert McCall. </figcaption>\n      </figure>\n\n      <p>\n        As seen in the table above, the post-industrial society is characterised\n        by a predominance of services over Industrial or Agricultural\n        activities.

Game here is\n        used in the broadest sense of cooperation, competition and play.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        An important aspect of the post-industrial economy is that it is\n        affluent. Industry is a smaller portion of the economy but not\n        necessarily in abolute term, just like the agricultural sector is a\n        small part of the economy yet we produce more food than ever before.\n        Indeed Hermann Kahn believes that the post-industrial society is also a\n        super-industrial society (another name for advanced mass-consumption).\n        However, the price of manufactured good will be so small that satisfying\n        basic needs such as housing or transportation will be cheap, and thus\n        the government might be willing to subsidize a decent \"floor\" standard\n        of living for all citizens.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        One of the interesting visions he holds for what such a society might\n        look like is the concept of the marriage between Machine and Garden.\n        Such society would be more suburban than urban, with technology becoming\n        at the same time ubuquitous yet blending seamlessly into our daily\n        lives. On the other hand, he considers that some societies, such as the\n        Japanese, might be comfortable working in an affluent, well designed and\n        efficient urban environment.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        He points out that measures such as GDP are more useful to characterise\n        and compare industrial economies than both pre-industrial and\n        post-industrial economies. The reason being that in the post-industrial\n        economy, an increasing amount of peoples lives will be spent not just on\n        services, but on non-transactional activities, such as leisure, hanging\n        out with family and friends, cheap entertainment, aesthetic pursuits,\n        learning for its own sake, etc. As the price of both services and\n        commodities fall, their consumption will not increase proportionally to\n        their abundance. A good example today is probably the internet. How much\n        time do people spend consuming essentially free content? Internet\n        companies are some of the biggest in the world, yet they arguably only\n        capture a small fraction of the value they create, much less so for\n        example than a railroad or a textile factory. Thus as the price of goods\n        and services decreases, the incentive to make more money to buy them\n        weakens as the things people actually want to buy are easier to obtain,\n        and non-market activities take more and more space in people's lives.\n        Reduced incentive for making more money would make most people, with the\n        exception of the most competitively driven, work less hard or less\n        productively in the economical sense. Thus altough the post-industrial\n        society is characterised by a high GDP per capita, it is also harder to\n        relate this figure to the average person's standard of living.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        These are the first two reasons why the post-industrial society is\n        characterised by a gradual slow down of economic growth. The next 200\n        years was written in part as a response to the book\n        <em>The Limits to Growth</em>. In particular, the main difference\n        between the two books is that, even if <em>The Next 200 Years</em>{\" \"}\n        believes that economic growth will slow down and perhaps eventually stop\n        during the next 200 years, it believes this will be the consequence of\n        affluence rather than scarcity. For Hermann Kahn, economic growth will\n        not be limited by resources or pollution or food production, but rather\n        by societal factors. Growth will slow down because people will not value\n        it as much, not because of any physical impossibilities.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        In particular, he believes that after a certain amount of development,\n        the marginal value that people assign to extra wealth diminishes\n        sharply, and thus the society's attention is increasingly directed\n        toward the negative consequences of technical and industrial\n        advancement. Harm reduction, environmental protection and a general\n        conservatism toward growth and development gradually takes hold of\n        society, leading to a steady state or near steady state economy. He\n        foresees that pollution mitigation and other environmental protection\n        will be an increasing part of the economy, diverting ressources from\n        compounding investments. This slowdown will be concretely implemeted\n        through regulations, increasing size of inefficient government\n        bureaucracies, and a diminished desire to attain enormous wealth.\n      </p>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <br />\n\n      <h2 id=\"the-new-class\">The New Class</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        What is particularily interesting is that he identifies that during the\n        process of transition, parts of society start having these\n        post-industrial outlooks and values before others. He identifies what he\n        calls the New Class, which are university educated, upper middle class\n        who do not perceive much benefit from extra growth, and start campaining\n        against it, perhaps a bit prematurely. This explains to him the wave of\n        anti-nuclear, anti-pollution, anti-industrial malthusian and anti-growth\n        movements in the 1960s and 1970s. Like fish in water, they do not\n        perceive the superindustrial society of which they are the avant-garde\n        and chief beneficiary, and thus become a powerful force for stagnation\n        and conservatism. In particular, their high number and strategic place\n        in society allows them to have a disproportionate influence on\n        regulatory bodies and public opinion. Effectively, they are able to make\n        less affluent, working class people advocate against their own\n        interests.\n      </p>\n\n      <div style={{ marginBottom: \"1em\" }}>\n        <figure>\n          <img\n            src={newEmphasesPart1Image}\n            alt=\"New Emphases part 1\"\n            style={{ width: \"80%\", height: \"auto\", marginBottom: \"1em\" }}\n          />\n          <img\n            src={newEmphasesPart2Image}\n            alt=\"New Emphases part 2\"\n            style={{ width: \"80%\", height: \"auto\" }}\n          />\n          <figcaption>\n            The 14 New Emphases, characteristics of the New Class\n          </figcaption>\n        </figure>\n      </div>\n      <p>\n        For Hermann Kahn, the appearance of this New Class is not necessarily a\n        bad thing. Indeed he believes it may be necessary to curb some of the\n        excesses of the superindustrial society. After all, according to him,\n        gradually the concerns of the New Class will become common to rest of\n        society as we get deeper into the post-industrial stage. However, the\n        loudness and strategic positionning of this New Class avant-garde in the\n        most developped nations may have a negative influence on the development\n        of the less developed nations, by giving them mixed messages about the\n        value of growth and development, when these countries really do need to\n        unify their society toward industrial growth to lift them out of\n        poverty. One of the great source of political mobilisation they have is\n        to look at the more developped countries for guidance. A similar concern\n        is that the New Class might be too self serving in its own country,\n        prioritising its needs for safety and conservatism over the needs of the\n        still less affluent parts of society, slowing its transition toward a\n        true post-industrial economy.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Indeed between <em>The Next 200 Years</em> and{\" \"}\n        <em>World Economic Development, 1979 And Beyond</em>, he revises his\n        growth estimate for the most advanced countries down, believing that the\n        impact of the anti-growth mindset is stronger and more pervasive than he\n        previously anticipated.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        On the other hand, he also wonders how humans would actually cope with a\n        society of affluence. Technological progress also enables powerful tools\n        for social control, surveillance and policing. The abundance of free\n        time and the lack of pressure to work hard to gain a living could lead\n        to an increase in discretionary behaviour, such as hedonistic behavior,\n        drug abuse, crime, etc. He also points out that the New Class could fall\n        victim to what he calls learned disabilities. People living their entire\n        lives inside a sheltered, engineered and comfortable reality, in a\n        service oriented world centered around abstractions and personal\n        relationships instead of materialistic struggles with nature may create\n        a generation of highly educated but impractical and delusional people,\n        who might be increasingly unable to maintain the superindustrial\n        society. He points out that if the rest of the intellectual class were\n        to put in practice the values expressed by the \"high art\" of his days\n        (what he calls 'late sensate' values), it will become truly decadent and\n        unable to cope with the challenges of the superindustrial society.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        He does spend some time grappling with the thinkers of societal cycles,\n        and moral and spiritual decadence, such as Spengler, Toynbee, Sombart\n        and Berdyaev, remarking how the development of the superindustrial\n        society might be a step toward the kind of comfort and complacency that\n        is classically associated with the conditions for the demise of great\n        civilisations. He also points out that society might spontaneously\n        become filled with taboos, totems, arbitrary pressure and thrill seeking\n        activities whose purpose is to introduce artificial hardships where\n        natural ones have been eliminated. Indeed, this society might have\n        increasingly strange and seemingly irrational customs to that end.\n        Boredom and nihilism might be the dominant trend of the age.\n      </p>\n\n      <figure\n        style={{\n          float: \"right\",\n          margin: \"0\",\n          padding: \"1em\",\n          paddingBottom: \"2em\",\n        }}\n      >\n        <img\n          src={culturalPhasesImage}\n          alt=\"Cultural Phases\"\n          style={{ maxWidth: \"100%\", height: \"auto\", display: \"block\" }}\n        />\n        <figcaption>\n          Representation of the cultural phases according to various authors.

Indeed he\n        did anticipate that american society would take a more conservative turn\n        in the 1980s in part as a correction to the 1960s and 1970s. Certainly,\n        his description of the post-industrial society and the New Class do seem\n        to resonate in many ways with today's world.\n      </p>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <br />\n\n      <h2 id=\"his-projections-for-our-world\">\n        Hit or miss? His projections for our world\n      </h2>\n\n      <p>\n        The elephant in the room is the collapse of the eastern block and the\n        dissolution of the Soviet Union. He did consider the possibility of\n        extended economic stagnation or some political turmoil, and even the\n        possibility of more autonomy for the eastern block countries, but these\n        scenarios were definitely at the fringe of his thinking. However, who\n        did? Who could anticipate Gorbachev, perestroika and glasnost? It is\n        still fascinating to see how unthinkable this was for the time, and it\n        definitely points to the difficulty of forecasting, even on the medium\n        term.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        However, taking one step back, it is striking that the dissolution of\n        the Soviet Union does not fundamentally challenge his vision of the\n        future. After all, the USSR was a rather marginal and insular part of\n        the world economy.

The estimates used are from the \"most probable\" or\n        \"World A\" scenario. Dollar values converted to 2011 dollars.\n      </figcaption>\n\n      <p>\n        It is notable how accurate his estimate of worldwide population and\n        world gdp per capita for the year 2000 was in both 1967 and 1979.\n        However, the differences between his world and our world is his forecast\n        of much stronger growth of the developped countries (especially in\n        1967), whereas in our world it is the developing countries that have\n        carried world growth. Initially, he underestimated the growth of China,\n        but then he gives a stellar estimate in 1979, reflecting a more\n        optimistic attitude with the change in direction imparted by Deng\n        Xiaoping. In 1967 he wildly overestimates the growth of Japan, France\n        and the US (altough it is remarkable how close the US numbers were to\n        his long term trend projection). At the time he had not not yet\n        developped his model of slowing growth in the advanced economies, thus\n        why his projection is too high. I could not find his precise projections\n        for the United-States, Japan and France in 1979, but they would have\n        probably been closer to the real numbers, like with China.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Japan's economic performance falls short of his projections. In the\n        1976, he projected that Japan would surpass the United States in GDP per\n        capita around 1990. However this was not to be. To the contrary, Japan's\n        economy entered a long period of stagnation in the 1990s, which is in\n        part due to the unforseen fertility problems mentionned below, causing a\n        decreasing workforce and increasing dependency ratio. On the other hand,\n        Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong have done pretty much as\n        well as he predicted. He did believe strongly in the ability of what he\n        called the \"Neo-Confuscian\" cultures to develop in some ways better than\n        the original industrial nations.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        During his days, a big concern was the gap between the rich and poor\n        countries. For him, this gap was actually a good thing, because the\n        wider the gap, the easier it would be for the poorer countries to catch\n        up, as the more affluent countries would have an incentive to look for\n        cheap labour, and the availability of capital for development would be\n        high.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Environmental challenges</h3>\n      <p>\n        He was quite right that we would be able to deal with most of the\n        negative externalities of industrialisation. In his days, air quality,\n        acid rains, waste or the ozone layer were seen by some as almost\n        intractable problems, yet, as he predicted, we were able to aquedately\n        mitigate them, and today we mostly enjoy the benefits of\n        industrialisation while also having clean air, water, and a better\n        preserved countryside. For example, as he predicted, we were able to\n        greatly reduce particle emissions from cars thanks to catalytic\n        converters and various improvements in engine design. In comparaison, at\n        the time, the potential for CO2 induced global warming was seen as a\n        secondary threat. I think where he alive today he would have a thing or\n        two to say about some of the more destructive solutions that are pushed\n        to deal with global warming, especially the pressure put on developing\n        countries to sacrifice their growth in order to emit less CO2.\n      </p>\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/emissions-of-air-pollutants?tab=chart\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        title=\"Emissions of air pollutants\"\n        style={{ width: \"100%\", height: \"600px\", border: \"0px none\" }}\n        allow=\"web-share; clipboard-write\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        However, the challenges remains very real, with the sharp decline in\n        biodiversity probably being the most worrying trend, and we do have to\n        limit global warming. We are still navigating the tortuous road of the\n        marriage of machine and garden.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>Ressources and energy</h3>\n      <p>\n        Writing around the time of the oil shocks, he did not believe that\n        either minerals (he covers extensively in <em>The Next 200 Years</em>\n        why all important minerals are either inexhaustible or can be\n        substituted) or energy would be a serious constraint on growth. For him,\n        the oil shocks were a temporary road bump caused by cartel economics. In\n        fact, he believed that there was likely plenty of oil and gas to last\n        for the foreseeable future. As we enter the post-industrial economy,\n        additionnal growth would become less energy intensive, easing the\n        potential requirements on energy ressources. In\n        <em>The Next 200 Years</em>, he was already anticipating the use of\n        shale oil, as well as other unconventional sources such as synthetics\n        made from coal liquefaction. He estimated (citing Brobst,D.A and Pratt,\n        W. P., Eds., U.S geological survey) that from shale oil alone, the\n        United States could sustain 120 years of energy consumption at current\n        projections. Let's have a look at these projections:\n      </p>\n\n      <table>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Year</th>\n          <th>The Next 200 Years (1976)</th>\n          <th>Actual</th>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>1975</th>\n          <td>73 PWh</td>\n          <td>76 PWh</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>1985</th>\n          <td>103 PWh</td>\n          <td>95 PWh</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>2000</th>\n          <td>176 PWh</td>\n          <td>123 PWh</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>2025</th>\n          <td>351 PWh</td>\n          <td>183 PWh</td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n      <figcaption>\n        World primary energy consumption in Petawatt-hours, taken from{\" \"}\n        <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-energy-substitution\">\n          ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-energy-substitution\n        </a>\n      </figcaption>\n\n      <p>\n        We can see that he forecasted a much more energy intensive world than\n        whe have had. His first projection, for 1985 is quite accurate, probably\n        tempered by him taking the oil shock into account. However, after that\n        he forecasted a very aggressive growth in energy consumption, which we\n        just didn't see. In that way, he is quite typical of his time, since for\n        the rest of the industrial revolution, strong economic growth was always\n        associated with strong growth in energy consumption. This might explain\n        why in our world we have twitter instead of flying cars or supersonic\n        jets.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Despite forseeing no immediate shortage of fossif fuels, he believed\n        that what he called the \"Eternal Sources\" of energy would become\n        competitive with fossil fuels during the early twenty first century.\n        Sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro, tidal, and nuclear\n        breeders (or regular designs with uranium mining from seawater) or\n        fusion.\n      </p>\n\n      <figure style={{ margin: \"0\", padding: \"1em\", paddingBottom: \"2em\" }}>\n        <img\n          src={eternalSourcesImage}\n          alt=\"Kahn's World A\"\n          style={{ maxWidth: \"60%\", height: \"auto\", display: \"block\" }}\n        />\n        <figcaption>\n          A graph showing the projected competitiveness of various eternal\n          sources of energy. Impressive how spot on the photovoltaic estimate\n          is.\n        </figcaption>\n      </figure>\n      <p>\n        It might be surprising that he had quite an ambivalent attitude\n        regarding nuclear power. He was very sensitive to the possibility of\n        nuclear proliferation, and in particular he opposed the development of\n        fast breeder reactors that would have created large amounts of plutonium\n        that could be easily reprocessed into bombs.\n      </p>\n      <h3>Work and leisure</h3>\n      <p>\n        He projected a continuation of the reduction in working hours, with the\n        US worker working around 1600 hours per year by the year 2000. We see in\n        the graph below that in fact, this trend in reduced working hours has\n        been broadly followed, altough the US is somewhat of an outlier, with\n        the amount of working hours per worker remaining more or less constant\n        since the 1970s.\n      </p>\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-working-hours-per-worker?tab=chart\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        title=\"Annual working hours per worker\"\n        style={{ width: \"100%\", height: \"600px\", border: \"0px none\" }}\n        allow=\"web-share; clipboard-write\"\n      />\n\n      <h3>Fertility</h3>\n      <p>\n        Another big aspect of today's world that he missed is the fertility\n        collapse of advanced nation. Like many demographers of his days, he\n        assumed that fertility would decrase rapidly, but somehow stabilise\n        close to the replacement rate (~2.1 children per woman). Indeed, in the\n        70s, it might have seemed plausible, as the sharp declines in fertility\n        of Japan, the US, the Soviet Union and western europe seemed to have\n        plateaued around replacement level. After all, the developed nations\n        were just coming out of a \"baby boom\", so the decrease might be\n        temporary. Thus he did not forsee that aging and even declining\n        populations would be one of the biggest challenges of the twenty first\n        century, and a strong incentive for replacement migration. He would\n        probably be appalled by South Korea's genocide-level demographic\n        collapse, and the extremely low fertility of the Neo-Confuscian\n        societies in general.\n      </p>\n      <iframe\n        src=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/children-per-woman-un?tab=chart&time=1950..latest&country=OWID_WRL~JPN~KOR~USA~Europe+%28UN%29\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        title=\"Children per woman\"\n        style={{ width: \"100%\", height: \"600px\", border: \"0px none\" }}\n        allow=\"web-share; clipboard-write\"\n      />\n\n      <p>\n        In term of immigration, he did forsee the shortage of cheap labour in\n        the more affluent countries. As he anticipated, this need was filled\n        through extensive guest worker programs and delocalisation. However, he\n        did not anticipate the large scale, long term and immobile nature of the\n        migration flows that we are seeing today, especially in Europe, in part\n        encouraged by low fertility.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3>A long list of innovations for the year 2000</h3>\n\n      <p>\n        In his book the Year 2000, he made a speculative list of likely\n        innovations before the year 2000. Let us give him a bit more time and\n        compare it with the world of today instead!\n      </p>\n\n      <details>\n        <summary>Innovation that happenned</summary>\n        <ul>\n

Most of what he expected did happen, and\n        most of that did happen before the year 2000. I was very impressed to\n        see that he was already anticipating the commercial extraction of oil\n        from shale in 1967. Some of his less likely innovations, such as true\n        artificial intelligence, seems to be just around the corner today. On\n        the whole, many of his projections seem quite reasonable, for example\n        seeing how many computer-related innovation that he expected. But we\n        have to remember that, at the time, predicting a handheld tv receiver\n        wasn't necessarily more realistic than predicting a moon base or ocean\n        mining. Well, for the moon base I think it's more on us than on him.\n      </p>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <br />\n\n      <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        On the big picture, he was quite spot on. In particular, against many of\n        the doom and gloom projections of his time, he predicted:\n      </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>No major wars</li>\n        <li>No ressource shortage, or food shortage</li>\n        <li>A richer world for almost everyone</li>\n        <li>The rise of Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Hong Kong</li>\n        <li>Guest workers, economic migration, and delocalisation</li>\n        <li>\n          Slowing growth of the rich countries, but strong growth of the\n          middling economies\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n\n      <p>\n        Even where he is wrong, it gives us an interesting contrast between the\n        expectations of his time, and today's reality. Most striking is how much\n        less energy intensive our world ended up being. His analysis of the New\n        Class and the challenges of the post-industrial society give a clear\n        framing for challenges with which we are still grappling today. Looking\n        at the expected innovations for the year 2000 shows that he had a really\n        good grasp of the real technological trends.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Thus, Hermann Kahn was able to get a lot of things right, which is quite\n        impressive, especially his 1967 predictions. It is unfortunate that he\n        did not live to see the rise of China, the collapse of the Soviet Union,\n        and the stagnation of Japan as these events he would probably have been\n        fascinated by these events. We are still riding the great transition,\n        shaping the post-industrial society. Which one will we chose to build?\n      </p>\n\n      <hr />\n\n      <br />\n\n      <h2 id=\"post-conclusion\">Post-Conclusion: What about Space?</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        In this age of abundance and leisure, Herman Kahn talks of those whose\n        appetite for adventure and exploration is not satiated by the safety and\n        relative stagnation of the post-industrial society. Enterprising people\n        who actively seek out challenge and difficult situations. He speculates\n        that for them the post-industrial society would be a dull and\n        unfulfilling existence, no matter how pleasant it might be. Space\n        exploration might become the outlet for these kind of individuals. He\n        does believe in the commercial potential of space, however he thinks\n        that space exploration will largely be done for its own sake, and for\n        the sake of larger ideals, such as the expansion and preservation of the\n        human race, life, and ideological or religious reasons.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        If space exploration were to take a serious turn, it is hard to speak of\n        limits to growth. As long as man explores space, there seem to be no\n        need for proximate limits for the scale of the human enterprise. Indeed\n        the entire galaxy isn't out of reach.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Thus, the super-industrial / post-industrial society need not be the end\n        point of human development, but to the contrary, provide the staging\n        ground, the opulent industrial base from which humanity can muster the\n        resources to launch itself into the stars. In the future, we might look\n        back and see in the post-industrial society not an end, but the true\n        beginning of our story.\n      </p>\n      <footer\n        style={{\n          marginTop: \"2em\",\n          borderTop: \"1px solid #ccc\",\n          paddingTop: \"1em\",\n          fontSize: \"0.9em\",\n          color: \"#666\",\n        }}\n      >\n        <p>\n          This page is based on the-monospace-web template created by{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://wickstrom.tech\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            Oskar Wickström\n          </a>{\" \"}\n          <a\n            href=\"https://github.com/owickstrom/the-monospace-web\"\n            target=\"_blank\"\n            rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n          >\n            https://github.com/owickstrom/the-monospace-web\n          </a>\n          .\n        </p>\n      </footer>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default PostIndustrialSociety;\n","import React from \"react\";\nimport \"./reset.css\";\nimport \"./reportstyle.css\";\nimport { Helmet } from \"react-helmet-async\";\n\ninterface Author {\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  website: string;\n}\n\nexport const ArticleHeader: React.FC<{\n  title: string;\n  subtitle: string;\n  image: string;\n  author: Author;\n  creationDate: string;\n  updatedDate: string;\n  version: string;\n}> = ({\n  title,\n  subtitle,\n  image,\n  author,\n  creationDate,\n  updatedDate,\n  version,\n}) => {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Helmet>\n        <title>{title}</title>\n        <meta name=\"description\" content=\"Growth and Transportation\" />\n        <meta\n          name=\"viewport\"\n          content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes\"\n        />\n        <meta name=\"author\" content={author.name} />\n        <meta name=\"dcterms.date\" content={creationDate} />\n        <meta name=\"dcterms.modified\" content={updatedDate} />\n        <link rel=\"icon\" href={image} />\n      </Helmet>\n      <table className=\"header\">\n        <tr>\n          <td colSpan={2} rowSpan={3} className=\"width-auto\">\n            <h1 className=\"title\">{title}</h1>\n            <span className=\"subtitle\">{subtitle}</span>\n          </td>\n          <th>Version</th>\n          <td className=\"width-min\">{version}</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Updated</th>\n          <td className=\"width-min\">\n            <time style={{ whiteSpace: \"pre\" }}>{updatedDate}</time>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Created</th>\n          <td className=\"width-min\">\n            <time style={{ whiteSpace: \"pre\" }}>{creationDate}</time>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n\n        <tr>\n          <th className=\"width-min\">Author</th>\n          <td className=\"width-auto\">\n            <a href={author.website}>\n              <cite>{author.name}</cite>\n            </a>{\" \"}\n            {author.email}\n          </td>\n          <th className=\"width-min\">License</th>\n          <td>\n            <a\n              href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\"\n              target=\"_blank\"\n              rel=\"license noopener noreferrer\"\n            >\n              <img\n                alt=\"Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License\"\n                style={{ borderWidth: 0, verticalAlign: \"middle\" }}\n                src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by/4.0/88x31.png\"\n              />\n            </a>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n      </table>\n    </>\n  );\n};\n","const _excluded = [\"as\", \"disabled\"];\nfunction _objectWithoutPropertiesLoose(source, excluded) { if (source == null) return {}; var target = {}; var sourceKeys = Object.keys(source); var key, i; for (i = 0; i < sourceKeys.length; i++) { key = sourceKeys[i]; if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue; target[key] = source[key]; } return target; }\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport { jsx as _jsx } from \"react/jsx-runtime\";\nexport function isTrivialHref(href) {\n  return !href || href.trim() === '#';\n}\nexport function useButtonProps({\n  tagName,\n  disabled,\n  href,\n  target,\n  rel,\n  role,\n  onClick,\n  tabIndex = 0,\n  type\n}) {\n  if (!tagName) {\n    if (href != null || target != null || rel != null) {\n      tagName = 'a';\n    } else {\n      tagName = 'button';\n    }\n  }\n  const meta = {\n    tagName\n  };\n  if (tagName === 'button') {\n    return [{\n      type: type || 'button',\n      disabled\n    }, meta];\n  }\n  const handleClick = event => {\n    if (disabled || tagName === 'a' && isTrivialHref(href)) {\n      event.preventDefault();\n    }\n    if (disabled) {\n      event.stopPropagation();\n      return;\n    }\n    onClick == null ?
