A good example today is probably the internet. How much time do people spend consuming essentially free content? Internet companies are some of the biggest in the world, yet they arguably only capture a small fraction of the value they create, much less so for example than a railroad or a textile factory. Thus as the price of goods and services decreases, the incentive to make more money to buy them weakens as the things people actually want to buy are easier to obtain, and non-market activities take more and more space in people's lives. Reduced incentive for making more money would make most people, with the exception of the most competitively driven, work less hard or less productively in the economical sense.
